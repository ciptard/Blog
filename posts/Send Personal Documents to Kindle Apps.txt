Send Personal Documents to Kindle Apps

Since the 3.3 Software Update for Kindle, Amazon has enabled support for 
syncing personal documents through Whispersync. The only thing missing, 
however, is that personal documents do not sync to Kindle Apps (iOS app, 
for example).

I've been using a workaround I discovered to send documents to my iPhone 
so I can read them on that, as well as my Kindle. This does **not**, 
however, sync your progress or notes. This method only allows you to 
make the documents accessable on the other apps. For me, that's good enough, I just have look up the last location and go to 
it before I start reading.
