How I use AutoHotkey
November 10, 2010

I've been using [AutoHotkey](http://www.autohotkey.com/) (AHK) for a while now as a keyboard shortcut app and it's working really really well for me so I thought I'd share. If you don't know what it is, AutoHotkey allows you to write scripts to automate tasks on your computer. I mainly use it for doing things when I press certain keys on my keyboard but you can make it do a lot more.

Here's a rundown of the things I use daily with AHK. I keep everything in one file so all of these features are available from just one executable that starts with Windows. If I need to add or modify a feature, I just modify the source and recompile. I always hated having a programming running all the time for the smallest features.

    Loop
    {
        sleep 1800000
        TrayTip, Take a break!,`n,0, 1
    }

First off we have a loop that shows a balloon tooltip in the notification area every 30 minutes (1800000ms) telling me to take a stretch break. I went through a few dedicated programs before writing my own super simple solution.

    ;Toggle mute - Scroll Lock
    ScrollLock:: Send {Volume_Mute}

This one-liner sets the function of the Scroll Lock button on my keyboard to mute/unmute volume. (The mute button on my laptop doesn't work, too lazy to find the right drivers) Also, if you're unfamiliar with AHK, the semicolon (";") is used to comment out lines.

    ;Toggle Always On Top - Ctrl Shift Space
    ^+SPACE::  Winset, Alwaysontop, , A

Another one-liner, see how simple this is? This one toggles the currently focused window's state between normal and always-on-top. Used to use a dedicated app for this, now it's just one line in my AHK script.

    PRINTSCREEN:: Send #+S

I started using [windroplr](http://windroplr.com/) recently (great app) but didn't like having to press `WIN Shift S` shortcut to take and upload screenshots. Simple enough, just map the Print Screen key to `WIN Shift S`.

    ;Paste as plaintext - Ctrl Shift V
    ^+v::
        ClipSaved := ClipboardAll
        clipboard = %clipboard%
        ClipWait, 2
        Send ^v
        Sleep, 1000
        Clipboard := ClipSaved
        ClipSaved =
    return

This one is a little more complex than the others. I use [Pidgin ](http://www.pidgin.im/) for IM and whenever I paste some text into the chat window, the formatting of all of my messages changes to the formatting of that text. So annoying! A little Googling led me to this snippit. This assigns `Ctrl Shift V` shortcut to strip the text in the clipboard of any formatting and paste. `Ctrl V` works as usual.
